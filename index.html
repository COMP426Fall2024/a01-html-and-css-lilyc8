        Appa is Avatar Aang's sky bison companion and served as his spirit
        guide. He is part of the Air Nomad civilization and was born in the
        Eastern Air Temple. Appa has brown eyes and has a white fur coat with
        brown stripes. He is able to fly and use air bending. As the Avatar's
        animal guide, he assists the Gaang through their journey and offers them
        his protection along with his loyalty. During the Hundred Year War, Appa
        was the last of his kind. He and Aang were the sole survivors of the
        East Temple Air Nomads. Because of his ability to fly, he was the main
        method of transportation for Team Avatar and he was an indispensable
        part of the team. His diet consists mostly of plants and fruits, his
        favorite food is hay.

        Appa has a great sense of humor along with a gentle and protective
        nature. He quickly became friends with all of Team Avatar, with the
        exception of Zuko. Although he is quite large, Appa is extremely
        affectionate and provides comfort to the group and acts as a soft
        mattress for them to sleep on. Despite Appa's gentle nature, he can also
        be incredibly fierce and determined when the lives of his friends are in
        danger. He is courageous and strong in battle.
