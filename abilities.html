            Appa has airbending abilities. He is able to use both his tail and
            mouth to channel airbender. He mainly used his ability to fly at
            extreme heights and avoid attacks. He is able to create powerful

            Because Appa is a bison, he naturally has a great amount of brute
            strength and endurance. He was able to lift two Fire Nation tanks
            and destroyed a boar in a fight. He is able to toss his opponents
            far away.

            While Appa may be huge, he has an amazing endurance. He is able to
            carrying all of Team Avatar across the seas throughout their
            journey. He sometimes takes breaks while flying, but he is also able
            to fly for days without stopping. An exampple of this would be when
            they were on the run from Azula and her squad, he flew relentlessly
            to escape from teh enemy.
