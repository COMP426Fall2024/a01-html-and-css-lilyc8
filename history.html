            Appa was young when he met Aang. They became friends after Aang
            offered him an apple. They lived in peace with the other members of
            East Air Temple. They would spend their days playing and learning
            with their peers. Just before the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang escaped
            the temple using Appa as his form of transportation. During their
            escape, they encountered a dangerous storm that swept them under the
            water and caused them to lose their consciousness. Aang was able to
            save both him and Appa through the use of his Avatar state, but they
            remained unconscious for 100 years until they were discovered by
            Katara and Sokka.

              While traveling through the Earth Kingdom, Appa got separated from
              the group when sandbenders kidnapped him in the middle of the Si
              Wong Desert. Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo were stuck in an
              underground Spirit library at the time and couldn’t help him. Appa
              was eventually sold to a Fire Nation circus. Appa managed to
              escape and returned to the desert where he last saw Aang. Appa
              continued his journey through the Earth Kingdom. He eventually
              came across the Kyoshi Warriors, who helped heal the wounds he had
              suffered during his time on the run. They wanted to take him back
              to Aang, but their plan was interrupted when Azula and her team
              attacked. Suki urged Appa to flee while she and the others stayed
              behind to fight. During his travels, Appa met Guru Pathik at the
              Eastern Air Temple. The Guru sensed Aang’s location by reading
              Appa’s energy, so Appa flew to Ba Sing Se. Unfortunately, he was
              captured by Long Feng and hidden beneath Lake Laogai. Zuko
              initially planned to use Appa to capture Aang, but after talking
              to his uncle Iroh, he changed his mind and freed the bison
              instead. Appa found his friends cornered by Long Feng and the Dai
              Li. He played a key role in helping them escape, even biting Long
              Feng in the leg. Aang was reunited with Appa. Later, Appa helped
              them break into the Royal Palace of Ba Sing Se.

              Appa stayed by Team Avatar’s side as they journeyed on, even
              joining Hakoda's crew for a bit. After getting a new saddle, he
              helped the group find Aang when he disappeared during a storm, and
              they all reunited on Crescent Island. While traveling through the
              Fire Nation, Appa had to stay hidden most of the time, with Aang
              and Katara disguising him as a cloud when he flew. He also wore
              armor during the failed invasion of the Fire Nation. Afterward,
              Appa took the younger members of the team to the Western Air
              Temple for safety. Despite everyone being unsure about Zuko at
              first, Appa welcomed him because he remembered how Zuko had freed
              him from Ba Sing Se. In the final days of the war, Appa helped the
              team look for Aang and later flew Zuko and Katara to face Azula.

              After the Hundred Year War ended, Appa was with the gang in Ba
              Sing Se as they celebrated at the Jasmine Dragon. A year later,
              Appa helped transport Fire Nation colonials and when the Harmony
              Restoration Movement failed, Appa flew the Gaang on a mission to
              Hira'a to search for Zuko's mother, Ursa. Though unhappy about
              Azula joining them, Appa still helped in a battle against a wolf
              spirit during the journey. Later, he flew the team and the Mother
              of Faces back to Hira'a. Appa was believed to be the last of his
              kind after the Air Nomad Genocide, but Aang eventually found a new
              herd of sky bison, and colonies of bison thrived at the air
              temples. Appa continued as Aang's animal guide.
